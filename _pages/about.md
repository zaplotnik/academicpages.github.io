In my research I am trying to figure out how to better use a plethora of tracer information to infer dynamics in 4D-Var.

Lately, I am working on the attribution of the vertical velocity to basic types of the atmospheric circulation: Rossby and inertia-gravity waves using [normal modes decomposition](https://modes.cen.uni-hamburg.de).

Within this scope, I am interested in the response of the large-scale atmospheric dynamics to warming climate.

In my research I am trying to figure out how to better use a plethora of tracer information to infer dynamics in 4D-Var.

Since lately, I have been working on the attribution of the vertical velocity to basic types of the atmospheric circulation: Rossby and inertia-gravity waves, using [normal modes decomposition software](https://modes.cen.uni-hamburg.de).

Attribution of vertical velocity Omega (Pa/s) to Rossby (left) and IG (right) motion types.

Within this scope, I am also interested in the response of the large-scale atmospheric dynamics to the warming climate.
